### **Report** 

The idea for our website is to provide a search function that when queried will search for an object that then is tied to a physical longitude and latitude and presents the user with a map for them to see where that object is. This design concept can span over many different aspects of google maps API and there isn’t any reason to limit ourselves on a specific search to location theme but at the moment we have decided to use the search function to find a location based off of social media hashtags and the gps imprint data that comes with that. This may be subject to change.

#### Tools:

Communication - We will be using Slack for our main form of communication, we will also meet weekly to discuss our progress face to face.

Development - To develop our website we will use the languages HTML/CSS & Javascript via the framework called Electron. We will use Google Maps API. The server runtime environment we will use is Node.js and the code editor Visual Studio Code. GitHub will be the service that we use to store our team repository as well as find information about current electron applications.

Information - To gather information about things we don’t understand or how to work through creating a concept we will use a number of online resources listed below as well as advice from our tutor Jeffrey Kranenburg.

* MDN (developer.mozilla.org) - Finding the use of syntax.
GitHub - Researching current Electron web apps to apply to our own concept and design.
Lynda.com - Following basic tutorials on Javascript and Electron to reinforce concepts that we will use in development phase.
* Youtube - Similar to Lynda.com, we will use user created videos to research unknown concepts to apply to our own design.
* W3Schools - Offers step by step information on Javascript development as well as syntax definitions, both of which will aid us in development.


#### Delegated roles:

* Belinda - Team Leader & Front end developer
